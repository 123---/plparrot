You will need to have a Postgres database instance running (8.2x, 8.3x, 8.4x, 8.5x) with the plpgsql PL language installed:

If you will be creating a new database:
    cd ~/postgresql
    initdb test
    createlang plpgsql test         # currently required by pgTAP

Now to build PL/Parrot:

    cd ~/git/plparrot
    make

To test PL/Parrot (uses pgTAP)

    psql test < t/test.sql
