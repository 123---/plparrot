=head1 TODO items for PL/Parrot

* Tests for the Socket PMC (does it even work?)

* Developer documentation

* End-user/sysadmin/DBA documentation

* use distutils.pir and/or allow install via Plumage ?

* Add support for returning "setof" supported datatypes (see PL/Perl test suite)

* Add support for custom datatypes (see PL/Perl test suite)

* Add support for more PG datatypes (in order of importance):

** Timestamp datatypes

*** These can currently be passed back and forth between Postgres + Parrot, but
there is no interface to modify them from PIR
