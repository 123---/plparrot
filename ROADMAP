=head1 PL/Parrot ROADMAP

This document describes the roadmap for PL/Parrot. Please be as specific as possible.

* Make installation and configuration easier

    In general, there should be a "Parrot way" to install PL/Parrot (via
    Plumage) and a "Postgres way" (whatever that is) to keep people in both
    camps happy.

* Implement spi_exec_query() for PIR

    This involves many intermediate steps that should be listed in detail here.
